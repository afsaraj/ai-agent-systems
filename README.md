🤖 AI Agent Systems Roadmap – By Afsar Ahamed

🎯 Goal

Master the architecture, cognition, memory, planning, tool use, and real-world deployment of autonomous AI agents — combining the reasoning power of LLMs with the ability to take action across APIs, browsers, and automation workflows.

This roadmap merges conceptual agent frameworks (like ReAct, CoT, AutoGPT) with practical execution (LangChain, browser automation, cloud APIs).

📍 Phase 1: Agent Foundations – Reasoning, Planning & Tools

🧠 Concepts

What is an AI agent? (LLM + tools + autonomy)

ReAct (reasoning + acting), Chain-of-Thought prompting

Function/tool calling paradigms

Routing, multi-step planning

🛠️ Tools

LangChain Agents

OpenAI Function Calling

LlamaIndex Agents

Toolformer (optional)

📦 Project: Build a command-line assistant that uses OpenAI tool-calling to fetch weather, news, or calendar events

📍 Phase 2: Memory & Persistence

🧬 Memory Types

Short-term memory (context window, chat history)

Long-term memory (vector DBs)

Episodic and semantic memory layers

Context-aware behavior and memory refresh

🛠️ Tools

FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone, ChromaDB

LangChain memory integrations

📦 Project: Agent that adapts to user preferences across sessions using vector memory

📍 Phase 3: Web Interaction & Tool Use

🔧 Real-World Abilities

Web scraping, API querying, parsing

File reading (PDFs, CSVs, emails)

Calculation, shell commands, document generation

🛠️ Tools

Requests, BeautifulSoup

LangChain Tools

DuckDuckGo API, SerpAPI

📦 Project: Research agent that scrapes a topic, summarizes it, and stores results in Notion

📍 Phase 4: Real API & Browser Integration

🔌 External Services

Gmail, Notion, Google Calendar, Slack, Discord, Trello, Stripe

OpenAPI/Swagger spec reading

OAuth, API key security

🌐 Browser Automation

Puppeteer + LangChain

Selenium, Playwright

Browserless API

📦 Project: AI assistant that logs into a site, fills a form, and sends summary via email or logs to a Notion DB

📍 Phase 5: Workflow Agents & Multi-Agent Systems

🧠 Planning & Coordination

Task planning and execution (planner-executor loop)

AutoGPT-style recursive agents

Multi-agent collaboration (CrewAI, LangGraph)

🛠️ Tools

LangGraph (LangChain)

CrewAI, AutoGPT, BabyAGI

Celery + Redis for background agents

📦 Project: "Startup Agent Team" — planner, researcher, and coder agent that collaboratively launch a product idea

📍 Phase 6: Deployment, Monitoring & Safety

🚀 Deployment & Infra

Serve via FastAPI, Docker, BackgroundTasks

Persistent agents (long-running stateful)

Agent hosting: Vercel, Hugging Face Spaces, Render

🔐 Safety & Ethics

Prompt injection filtering

Guardrails, token usage limits

API usage auditing

📦 Project: Personal cloud-based assistant with real-time scheduling + webhook integration + safety filters
