# 🤖 AI Agent Systems Roadmap (AutoGPT, Multi-Agent AI) – By Afsar Ahamed

## 🎯 Goal  
Master the design, deployment, and orchestration of autonomous AI agents using LLMs — including multi-agent collaboration, tool use, memory, and task planning.

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Agent Foundations

**🧠 Core Concepts**
- [ ] What is an AI Agent? (LLM + memory + tools + autonomy)
- [ ] ReAct, CoT (chain-of-thought) reasoning
- [ ] Tool-use prompting (API calling, calculators, web scraping)

**🧰 Tools**
- LangChain Agents
- OpenAI Function Calling
- Hugging Face Toolformer concepts

---

## 📍 Phase 2: Memory & Persistence

**🧬 Types of Memory**
- [ ] Short-term memory (chat history)
- [ ] Long-term memory (vector store, knowledge base)
- [ ] Episodic memory and retrieval strategy

**🧰 Tools**
- ChromaDB, FAISS, Weaviate
- LangChain memory wrappers

**📦 Project Idea:**  
Agent that remembers user preferences and modifies its behavior over multiple sessions

---

## 📍 Phase 3: Tool Use & Web Interaction

**🔧 Abilities**
- [ ] Search the web, scrape pages
- [ ] Execute Python code, use calculators
- [ ] File reading, parsing documents (PDF, CSV)

**🧰 Tools**
- DuckDuckGo Search API, Requests, BeautifulSoup
- LangChain Tools, SerpAPI, Browser drivers

**📦 Project Idea:**  
"Research Agent" that can search a topic, summarize, and store results to a personal knowledge base

---

## 📍 Phase 4: Planning & Multi-Agent Systems

**📋 Planning Abilities**
- [ ] Task breakdown (Planner-Executor pattern)
- [ ] Recursive agents (AutoGPT-style)
- [ ] Role-based multi-agent systems (e.g., CrewAI)

**🧰 Tools**
- AutoGPT, BabyAGI, AgentVerse, CrewAI
- LangGraph (LangChain's multi-agent orchestration)

**📦 Project Idea:**  
"Startup Agent Team" — planner, researcher, and developer agents that collaborate on launching a product idea

---

## 📍 Phase 5: Evaluation, Security, & Deployment

**📏 Evaluation**
- [ ] HumanEval, test task completions
- [ ] Goal-based reward functions
- [ ] Cost tracking (token usage, API latency)

**🔒 Guardrails**
- [ ] Limit tool access, prompt injections
- [ ] Memory management to prevent bloating
- [ ] Audit logs and observability

**🚀 Deployment**
- FastAPI + background agent tasks
- Docker + API gateway for serving
- Long-running agents with persistence
